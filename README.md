My take on Frontend Mentor "Sunnyside agency" landing page challenge 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, 
      this is my take on 
      Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page challenge - 
      https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef,

    It's by no means a pixel perfect copy of original design, also I made some changes in design, e.g changed mobile navbar button style and added opening and closing animation to it. I also tried to make website responsive not only for Mobiles(320px - 450px range) and Desktops(above 1400px),but also for everything in between. Test/Play with the website and don't be shy, any feedback is appreciated.
